Title

Database Script Modification to Exclude Suspended Portfolios from Report

⸻

Short Description

Modification of existing SQL query to prevent extraction of suspended portfolios in the generated report.

⸻

Description

The current database script/SQL query used to extract and generate the report is incorrectly including suspended portfolios in the output.

As per business requirement, suspended portfolios should not be part of the report. Therefore, the SQL query needs to be corrected to properly filter and exclude portfolios with suspended status.

This change involves updating the existing query logic to ensure accurate report generation.

⸻

Justification
	•	The report currently contains incorrect data (suspended portfolios).
	•	This does not align with business reporting requirements.
	•	Data accuracy is critical for reporting and decision-making.

The correction is required to ensure proper filtering and compliance with reporting standards.

⸻

Business Impact

If not corrected:
	•	Incorrect reports will be generated and shared.
	•	Potential confusion for business users and clients.
	•	Risk of reputational impact due to inaccurate reporting.

Correcting the query ensures accurate and reliable reporting.

⸻

Technical Impact
	•	Update to existing SQL query logic.
	•	No infrastructure changes.
	•	No impact to other modules or applications.
	•	Impact limited only to the report generation process.

⸻

Implementation Plan
	1.	Review the existing SQL query used for report generation.
	2.	Modify the WHERE condition to exclude portfolios with “Suspended” status.
	3.	Test the updated query in UAT with sample data.
	4.	Validate report output with business users.
	5.	Deploy the updated query to Production during approved window.
	6.	Generate report and confirm correctness.

⸻

Backout Plan

If any issue occurs after deployment:
	•	Revert to the previous version of the SQL query.
	•	Validate report generation using the original logic.

⸻

Post-Implementation Verification Plan
	1.	Generate the report after deployment.
	2.	Confirm suspended portfolios are no longer included.
	3.	Validate report totals and counts.
	4.	Obtain business confirmation of accuracy.
